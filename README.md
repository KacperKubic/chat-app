<h1>Chat App</h1>
<hr><h3>Fully responsive chat app made with React, NodeJS and Socket.io</h3>
</br><p>It allows the user to enter a username and a roomId. Then the user can exchange messages with other user that is in the room with the same ID as them. <br/>This is my second fullstack project. During the development of it I learned about TCP and websockets.</p><h2>Technologies Used</h2>
